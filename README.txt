Project 2

In Project 2, we were asked to pick between implementing three different sort types and comparing their run speeds to each other, or implementing an optimized quick sort and
comparing its run speed to std::stable_sort. I decided to do the first option.
We were given the option to implement three of the following four sorts: quick sort, heap sort, bubble sort, and merge sort. For this project, I decided to implement
heap sort, bubble sort, and merge sort.
